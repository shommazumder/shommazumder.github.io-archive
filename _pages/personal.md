I am a PhD Candidate in Government at Harvard University and a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration at the Harvard Kennedy School. My core research agenda highlights the central role of violence–both directly and indirectly–in shaping the politics of race, class, and gender in the United States. What role, if any, does mass warfare have in catalyzing social change? Why do groups engage in violence against each other? I use a combination of historical, administrative data and quasi-experimental techniques to help answer questions like these. By putting American politics in historical perspective, I show that the American experience may not be so different from that of other nations.

Prior to Harvard, I worked at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) and [National Public Radio](http://www.npr.org/). I received my Bachelors of Science in Foreign Service from the Walsh School of Foreign Service at [Georgetown University](http://sfs.georgetown.edu/). When not buried in my computer, I enjoy [bouldering](http://brooklynboulders.com/somerville/), watching live music, and finding new foods to braise.
