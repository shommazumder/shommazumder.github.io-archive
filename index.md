I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Government at Harvard University and a *James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration* at the Harvard Kennedy School. My dissertation book project **Immigrants into Americans: The Political Origins of National Assimmilation, 1880-1930** explores the ways in which European immigrants assimilated into becoming white, Americans in the late 19th and early 20th century. It places particular emphasis on the role of mass warfare in forging immigrants into Americans while also exploring the role of other state policies such as mass schooling and citizenship.

More broadly, my dissertation work fits into a larger research agenda that seeks to understand whether and how violence and coercion--both directly and indirectly--in shape the politics of social identity. To study this, I use novel historical and archival "big" data combined with rigorous attention to causality. By putting American politics in historical perspective, I seek to understand how the American experience may not be so different from that of other nations.

A secondary research agenda of mine seeks to understand the causes and consequences of inequality. I examine a wide array of contexts including collective action, unions, automation, and the welfare state within advanced industrialized countries using a combination of new data, natural experiments, and field experimental methods.

My work is published or forthcoming in the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, and the *Review of International Organizations*. You can find my [C.V. here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zlr80hzecyne03v/Mazumder_Academic_CV.pdf?raw=1)
